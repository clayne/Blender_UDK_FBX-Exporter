UDK Blender FBX Export
======================

Fbx export script with support for custom vertex normals and smoothing groups, optimized for UDK

based on the fbx exporter included in Blender 2.68


Additions + fixes:
------------------

-- Support for my smoothing groups script available here:

https://github.com/isathar/Blender_FBX_Smoothing_Groups

(activated by selecting Groups as the smoothing type on export)

-- Support for custom vertex normals created with asdn's Recalc Vertex Normals script available here:

http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?251402-Addon-Recalc-Vertex-Normals

(TBD: support for other normals addons)

-- removed XNA-specific options from menu

-- uses the root bone as root instead of creating its own
